This is a weather site on Java EE (Servlets, jsp and more). I used here a OpenWeatherMap API in order to get information about weather.
If you want start it you should this:
1. Install JDK, apache maven and development environment(I used VScode). You can use another code editor
2. Open code editor or development enviroment
3. Edit configuration and open this project
4.
