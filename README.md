This is a weather site on Java EE (Servlets, jsp and more). I used here a OpenWeatherMap API in order to get information about weather.
If you want start it you should this:
1. Install JDK, apache maven and development environment(I used VScode). You can use another code editor
2. Open code editor or development enviroment
3. Edit configuration and open this project
4. Reboot pom.xml and open maven window
5. Find jetty.start and click on it
6. Jetty.start start server and you can open some browser and write localhost:8080 open site
